Test code and instance generation for "Computing Motion Plans for Assembling Particles with Global Control" by Patrick Blumenberg, Arne Schmidt, Aaron T. Becker, 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2023),  be held October 1 â€“ 5, 2023 at Huntington Place in Detroit Michigan.

## Abstract:
 We investigate motion planning algorithms for the assembly of shapes in the *tilt model* in which unit-square tiles move in a grid world under the influence of uniform external forces and self-assemble according to certain rules. 
 We provide several heuristics and experimental evaluation of their success rate, solution length,  and runtime.
